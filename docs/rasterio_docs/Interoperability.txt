Image processing software

Some python image processing software packages
organize arrays differently than rasterio. The interpretation of a
3-dimension array read fromrasteriois:

while image processing software likescikit-image,pillowandmatplotlibare generally ordered:

The number of rows defines the dataset’s height, the columns are the dataset’s width.

Numpy provides a way to efficiently swap the axis order and you can use the
following reshape functions to convert between raster and image axis order:


--- CODE BLOCK ---
(bands, rows, columns)

--- CODE BLOCK ---
(rows, columns, bands)

--- CODE BLOCK ---
>>> import rasterio
>>> from rasterio.plot import reshape_as_raster, reshape_as_image

>>> raster = rasterio.open("tests/data/RGB.byte.tif").read()
>>> raster.shape
(3, 718, 791)

>>> image = reshape_as_image(raster)
>>> image.shape
(718, 791, 3)

>>> raster2 = reshape_as_raster(image)
>>> raster2.shape
(3, 718, 791)
