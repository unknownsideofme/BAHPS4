AdaptiveFilter

This tool performs a type of adaptive filter on a raster image. An adaptive filter can be used to reduce
the level of random noise (shot noise) in an image. The algorithm operates by calculating the average
value in a moving window centred on each grid cell. If the absolute difference between the window mean
value and the centre grid cell value is beyond a user-defined threshold (--threshold), the grid cell in the
output image is assigned the mean value, otherwise it is equivalent to the original value. Therefore, the
algorithm only modifies the image where grid cell values are substantially different than their neighbouring
values.

Neighbourhood size, or filter size, is specified in the x and y dimensions using the--filterxand--filteryflags. These dimensions should be odd, positive integer values (e.g. 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.).

BilateralFilter

This tool can be used to perform an edge-preserving smoothing filter, or bilateral filter, on an image. A bilateral
filter can be used to emphasize the longer-range variability in an image, effectively acting to smooth the image,
while reducing the edge blurring effect common with other types of smoothing filters. As such, this filter is very
useful for reducing the noise in an image. Bilateral filtering is a non-linear filtering technique introduced by
Tomasi and Manduchi (1998). The algorithm operates by convolving a kernel of weights with each grid cell and its
neighbours in an image. The bilateral filter is related to Gaussian smoothing, in that the weights of the convolution
kernel are partly determined by the 2-dimensional Gaussian (i.e. normal) curve, which gives stronger weighting to
cells nearer the kernel centre. Unlike theGaussianFilter, however, the bilateral kernel weightings are also
affected by their similarity to the intensity value of the central pixel. Pixels that are very different in intensity
from the central pixel are weighted less, also based on a Gaussian weight distribution. Therefore, this non-linear
convolution filter is determined by the spatial and intensity domains of a localized pixel neighborhood.

The heavier weighting given to nearer and similar-valued pixels makes the bilateral filter an attractive alternative
for image smoothing and noise reduction compared to the much-used Mean filter. The size of the filter is determined
by setting the standard deviation distance parameter (--sigma_dist); the larger the standard deviation the larger
the resulting filter kernel. The standard deviation can be any number in the range 0.5-20 and is specified in the
unit of pixels. The standard deviation intensity parameter (--sigma_int), specified in the same units as the z-values,
determines the intensity domain contribution to kernel weightings.

CannyEdgeDetection

Note this tool is part of aWhiteboxTools extension product. Please visitWhitebox Geospatial Inc.for information about purchasing a license
activation key (https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/extension-pricing/).

This tool performs aCanny edge-detectionfiltering
operation on an input image (--input). The Canny edge-detection filter is a multi-stage filter that
combines a Gassian filtering (GaussianFilter) operation with various thresholding operations to
generate a single-cell wide edges output raster (--output). The--sigmaparameter, measured in grid
cells determines the size of the Gaussian filter kernel. The--lowand--highparameters determine
the characteristics of the thresholding steps; both parameters range from 0.0 to 1.0.

By default, the output raster will be Boolean, with 1's designating edge-cells. It is possible, using the--add_backparameter to add the edge cells back into the original image, providing an edge-enchanced
output, similar in concept to theUnsharpMaskingoperation.

ConservativeSmoothingFilter

This tool performs a conservative smoothing filter on a raster image. A conservative smoothing filter can be used
to remove short-range variability in an image, effectively acting to smooth the image. It is particularly useful
for eliminating local spikes and reducing the noise in an image. The algorithm operates by calculating the
minimum and maximum neighbouring values surrounding a grid cell. If the cell at the centre of the kernel is
greater than the calculated maximum value, it is replaced with the maximum value in the output image. Similarly,
if the cell value at the kernel centre is less than the neighbouring minimum value, the corresponding grid cell
in the output image is replaced with the minimum value. This filter tends to alter an image very little compared
with other smoothing filters such as theMeanFilter,EdgePreservingMeanFilter,BilateralFilter,MedianFilter,GaussianFilter, orOlympicFilter.

Neighbourhood size, or filter size, is specified in the x and y dimensions using the--filterxand--filteryflags. These dimensions should be odd, positive integer values (e.g. 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.).

DiffOfGaussianFilter

This tool can be used to perform a difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) filter on a raster image. In digital
image processing, DoG is a feature enhancement algorithm that involves the subtraction of one blurred
version of an image from another, less blurred version of the original. The blurred images are obtained
by applying filters with Gaussian-weighted kernels of differing standard deviations to the input image
(--input). Blurring an image using a Gaussian-weighted kernel suppresses high-frequency spatial
information and emphasizes lower-frequency variation. Subtracting one blurred image from the other
preserves spatial information that lies between the range of frequencies that are preserved in the
two blurred images. Thus, the difference-of-Gaussians is a band-pass filter that discards all but a
specified range of spatial frequencies that are present in the original image.

The algorithm operates by differencing the results of convolving two kernels of weights with each grid
cell and its neighbours in an image. The weights of the convolution kernels are determined by the 2-dimensional
Gaussian (i.e. normal) curve, which gives stronger weighting to cells nearer the kernel centre. The size of
the two convolution kernels are determined by setting the two standard deviation parameters (--sigma1and--sigma2); the larger the standard deviation the larger the resulting filter kernel. The second standard
deviation should be a larger value than the first, however if this is not the case, the tool will automatically
swap the two parameters. Both standard deviations can range from 0.5-20.

The difference-of-Gaussians filter can be used to emphasize edges present in an image. Other edge-sharpening
filters also operate by enhancing high-frequency detail, but because random noise also has a high spatial
frequency, many of these sharpening filters tend to enhance noise, which can be an undesirable artifact.
The difference-of-Gaussians filter can remove high-frequency noise while emphasizing edges. This filter can,
however, reduce overall image contrast.

DiversityFilter

This tool assigns each cell in the output grid the number of different values in a moving window centred on
each grid cell in the input raster. The input image should contain integer values but floating point data
are allowable and will be handled by multiplying pixel values by 1000 and rounding. Neighbourhood size, or
filter size, is specified in the x and y dimensions using the--filterxand--filteryflags. These
dimensions should be odd, positive integer values, e.g. 3, 5, 7, 9... If the kernel filter size is the same
in the x and y dimensions, the silent--filterflag may be used instead (command-line interface only).

EdgePreservingMeanFilter

This tool performs a type of edge-preserving mean filter operation on an input image (--input). The filter, a
type of low-pass filter, can be used to emphasize the longer-range variability in an image, effectively acting to
smooth the image and to reduce noise in the image. The algorithm calculates the average value in a moving window
centred on each grid cell, including in the averaging only the set of neighbouring values for which the absolute
value difference with the centre value is less than a specified threshold value (--threshold). It is, therefore,
similar to theBilateralFilter, except all neighbours within the threshold difference are equally weighted and
neighbour distance is not accounted for. Filter kernels are always square, and filter size, is specified using
the--filterparameter. This dimensions should be odd, positive integer values, e.g. 3, 5, 7, 9...

This tool works with both greyscale and red-green-blue (RGB) input images. RGB images are decomposed into
intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) and the filter is applied to the intensity channel. If an RGB image is input, the
threshold value must be in the range 0.0-1.0 (more likely less than 0.15), where a value of 1.0 would result in an ordinary mean filter
(MeanFilter). NoData values in the input image are ignored during filtering.

EmbossFilter

This tool can be used to perform one of eight 3x3 emboss filters on a raster image. Like theSobelFilterandPrewittFilter, theEmbossFilteris often applied in edge-detection applications. While these other two
common edge-detection filters approximate the slope magnitude of the local neighbourhood surrounding each
grid cell, theEmbossFiltercan be used to estimate the directional slope. The kernel weights for each of
the eight available filters are as follows:

North (n)

Northeast (ne)

East (e)

Southeast (se)

South (s)

Southwest (sw)

West (w)

Northwest (nw)

The user must specify the--direction, options include 'n', 's', 'e', 'w', 'ne', 'se', 'nw', 'sw'. The user may also optionally
clip the output image distribution tails by a specified amount (e.g. 1%).

FastAlmostGaussianFilter

The tool is somewhat modified from Dr. Kovesi's original Matlab code in that it
works with both greyscale and RGB images (decomposes to HSI and uses the intensity
data) and it handles the case of rasters that contain NoData values. This adds
complexity to the original 20 additions and 5 multiplications assertion of the
original paper.

Also note, for small values of sigma (< 1.8), you should probably just use the
regular GaussianFilter tool.

GaussianFilter

This tool can be used to perform a Gaussian filter on a raster image. A Gaussian filter
can be used to emphasize the longer-range variability in an image, effectively acting to
smooth the image. This can be useful for reducing the noise in an image. The algorithm
operates by convolving a kernel of weights with each grid cell and its neighbours in an
image. The weights of the convolution kernel are determined by the 2-dimensional Gaussian
(i.e. normal) curve, which gives stronger weighting to cells nearer the kernel centre. It
is this characteristic that makes the Gaussian filter an attractive alternative for image
smoothing and noise reduction than theMeanFilter. The size of the filter is determined
by setting the standard deviation parameter (--sigma), which is in units of grid cells;
the larger the standard deviation the larger the resulting filter kernel. The standard
deviation can be any number in the range 0.5-20.

GaussianFilterworks with both greyscale and red-green-blue (RGB) colour images. RGB images are
decomposed into intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) and the filter is applied to the intensity
channel. NoData values in the input image are ignored during processing.

Like many low-pass filters, Gaussian filtering can significantly blur well-defined edges in
the input image. TheEdgePreservingMeanFilterandBilateralFilteroffer more robust
feature preservation during image smoothing.GaussianFilteris relatively slow compared to
theFastAlmostGaussianFiltertool, which offers a fast-running approximatation to a
Gaussian filter for larger kernel sizes.

HighPassBilateralFilter

This tool can be used to perform a high-pass bilateral filter. A high-pass filter is one which emphasizes short-scale
variation within an image, usually by differencing the input image value from the result of a low-pass, smoothing filter.
In this case, the low-pass filter is an edge-preserving bilateral filter (BilateralFilter). High-pass filters are
often dominated by edges (transitions from high values to low values or vice versa) within an image. Because the
bilateral filter is an edge-preserving filter, the high-pass bilateral filter output is not dominated by edges, instead
emphasizing local-scale image texture patters. This filter is excellent for mapping image textures.

The size of the filter is determined  by setting the standard deviation distance parameter (--sigma_dist); the
larger the standard deviation the larger the resulting filter kernel. The standard deviation can be any number in
the range 0.5-20 and is specified in the unit of pixels. The standard deviation intensity parameter (--sigma_int),
specified in the same units as the image values, determines the intensity domain contribution to kernel weightings.
If the input image is an RGB composite, the intensity value is filtered, and the intensity parameter should
lie 0 > parameter < 1, with typical values ranging from 0.05 to 0.25. If the input image is not an RGB colour
composite, appropriate values of this parameter will depend on the range of input values and will likely be
considerably higher.

KNearestMeanFilter

This tool performs a k-nearest mean filter on a raster image. A mean filter can be used to emphasize the
longer-range variability in an image, effectively acting to smooth or blur the image. This can be useful
for reducing the noise in an image. The algorithm operates by calculating the average of a specified
number (k) values in a moving window centred on each grid cell. Thekvalues used in the average are
those cells in the window with the nearest intensity values to that of the centre cell. As such, this is
a type of edge-preserving smoothing filter. TheBilateralFilterandEdgePreservingMeanFilterare
examples of more sophisticated edge-preserving smoothing filters.

Neighbourhood size, or filter size, is specified in the x and y dimensions using the--filterxand--filteryflags. These dimensions should be odd, positive integer values (e.g. 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.).

LaplacianFilter

This tool can be used to perform a Laplacian filter on a raster image. A Laplacian filter can be used
to emphasize the edges in an image. As such, this filter type is commonly used in edge-detection
applications. The algorithm operates by convolving a kernel of weights with each grid cell and its
neighbours in an image. Four 3x3 sized filters and one 5x5 filter are available for selection. The
weights of the kernels are as follows:

3x3(1)

3x3(2)

3x3(3)

3x3(4)

5x5(1)

5x5(2)

The user must specify the--variant, including '3x3(1)', '3x3(2)', '3x3(3)', '3x3(4)', '5x5(1)', and '5x5(2)'.
The user may also optionally clip the output image distribution tails by a specified amount (e.g. 1%).

LaplacianOfGaussianFilter

The Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) is a spatial filter used for edge enhancement and is closely related to the
difference-of-Gaussians filter (DiffOfGaussianFilter). The formulation of the LoG filter algorithm is based
on the equation provided in the Hypermedia Image Processing Reference (HIPR) 2. The LoG operator calculates
the second spatial derivative of an image. In areas where image intensity is constant, the LoG response will
be zero. Near areas of change in intensity the LoG will be positive on the darker side, and negative on the
lighter side. This means that at a sharp edge, or boundary, between two regions of uniform but different
intensities, the LoG response will be:

zero at a long distance from the edge,positive just to one side of the edge,negative just to the other side of the edge,zero at some point in between, on the edge itself.

zero at a long distance from the edge,

positive just to one side of the edge,

negative just to the other side of the edge,

zero at some point in between, on the edge itself.

The user may optionally choose to reflecting the data along image edges.NoDatavalues in the input image are
similarly valued in the output. The output raster is of the float data type and continuous data scale.

LineDetectionFilter

This tool can be used to perform one of four 3x3 line-detection filters on a raster image. These
filters can be used to find one-cell-thick vertical, horizontal, or angled (135-degrees or
45-degrees) lines in an image. Notice that line-finding is a similar application to edge-detection.
Common edge-detection filters include the Sobel and Prewitt filters. The kernel weights for each of
the four line-detection filters are as follows:

'v' (Vertical)

'h' (Horizontal)

'45' (Northeast-Southwest)

'135' (Northwest-Southeast)

The user must specify the--variant, including 'v', 'h', '45', and '135', for vertical, horizontal,

MajorityFilter

This tool performs a majority (or modal) filter on a raster image. A mode filter assigns each
cell in the output grid the most commonly occurring value, i.e. mode, in a moving window centred
on each grid cell. Mode filters should only be applied to input images of a categorical data
scale. The input image should contain integer values but floating point data will be handled using a multiplier.
Because it requires binning the values in the window, a relatively computationally intensive
task,MajorityFilteris considerably less efficient than other smoothing filters. This may pose a problem
for large images or large neighbourhoods. Like all WhiteboxTools' filters, however, this tool is
parallelized, benefitting from multi-core processors, and the tool also takes advantage of the redundancy of
the overlapping areas of filter windows along a row of data.

Neighbourhood size, or filter size, is determined by the user-defined x and y dimensions. These dimensions
should be odd, positive integer values (e.g. 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.).

NoData values in the input image are ignored during filtering. When the neighbourhood around a grid cell extends
beyond the edge of the grid, NoData values are assigned to these sites. In the event of multiple modes, i.e.
neighbourhoods for which there is more than one class with tied and maximal frequency within the neighbourhood,
the tool will report the first-discovered class value in the output raster. This is unlikely to be an issue
for larger filter windows, but may be more problematic at smaller window sizes.

MaximumFilter

This tool assigns each cell in the output grid (--output) the maximum value in a moving window centred on each grid

These dimensions should be odd, positive integer values, e.g. 3, 5, 7, 9... If the kernel filter size is the same in
the x and y dimensions, the silent--filterflag may be used instead (command-line interface only).

This tool takes advantage of the redundancy between overlapping, neighbouring filters to enhance computationally
efficiency. Like most of WhiteboxTools' filters, it is also parallelized for further efficiency.

MeanFilter

This tool performs a mean filter operation on a raster image. A mean filter, a type of low-pass filter, can be
used to emphasize the longer-range variability in an image, effectively acting to smooth the image. This can be
useful for reducing the noise in an image. This tool utilizes an integral image approach (Crow, 1984) to ensure highly
efficient filtering that is invariant to filter size. The algorithm operates by calculating the average value
in a moving window centred on each grid cell.  Neighbourhood size, or filter size, is specified in the x and y
dimensions using the--filterxand--filteryflags. These dimensions should be odd, positive integer values,
e.g. 3, 5, 7, 9... If the kernel filter size is the same in the x and y dimensions, the silent--filterflag
may be used instead (command-line interface only).

Although commonly applied in digital image processing, mean filters are
generally considered to be quite harsh, with respect to their impact on the image, compared to other smoothing
filters such as the edge-preserving smoothing filters including theBilateralFilter,MedianFilter,OlympicFilter,EdgePreservingMeanFilterand evenGaussianFilter.

This tool works with both greyscale and red-green-blue (RGB) images. RGB images are
decomposed into intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) and the filter is applied to the intensity
channel. NoData values in the input image are ignored during filtering. NoData values are assigned to all sites beyond
the raster.

MedianFilter

This tool performs a median filter on a raster image. Median filters, a type of low-pass filter, can be used to emphasize
the longer-range variability in an image, effectively acting to smooth the image. This can be useful for reducing the
noise in an image. The algorithm operates by calculating the median value (middle value in a sorted list) in a moving
window centred on each grid cell. Specifically, this tool uses the efficient running-median filtering algorithm of Huang
et al. (1979). The median value is not influenced by anomolously high or low values in the distribution to the extent
that the average is. As such, the median filter is far less sensitive to shot noise in an image than the mean filter.

Neighbourhood size, or filter size, is specified in the x and y dimensions using the--filterxand--filteryflags.
These dimensions should be odd, positive integer values (e.g. 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.).

the x and y dimensions, the silent--filterflag may be used instead (command-line interface only).

This tool takes advantage of the redundancy between overlapping, neighbouring filters to enhance computationally
efficiency. Like most of WhiteboxTools' filters, it is also parallelized for further efficiency.

OlympicFilter

This filter is a modification of theMeanFilter, whereby the highest and lowest values in the kernel are
dropped, and the remaining values are averaged to replace the central pixel. The result is a low-pass smoothing
filter that is more robust than theMeanFilter, which is more strongly impacted by the presence of outlier
values. It is named after a system of scoring Olympic events.

PercentileFilter

This tool calculates the percentile of the center cell in a moving filter window applied to an input image (`--input).
This indicates the value below which a given percentage of the neighbouring values in within the filter fall. For example,
the 35th percentile is the value below which 35% of the neighbouring values in the filter window may be found. As such,
the percentile of a pixel value is indicative of the relative location of the site within the statistical distribution
of values contained within a filter window. When applied to input digital elevation models, percentile is a measure of
local topographic position, or elevation residual.

Neighbourhood size, or filter size, is specified in the x and y dimensions using the--filterxand--filteryflags.
These dimensions should be odd, positive integer values, e.g. 3, 5, 7, 9... If the kernel filter size is the same in
the x and y dimensions, the silent--filterflag may be used instead (command-line interface only).

This tool takes advantage of the redundancy between overlapping, neighbouring filters to enhance computationally
efficiency, using a method similar to Huang et al. (1979). This efficient method of calculating percentiles requires
rounding of floating-point inputs, and therefore the user must specify the number of significant digits (--sig_digits)
to be used during the processing. Like most of WhiteboxTools' filters, this tool is also parallelized for further efficiency.

PrewittFilter

This tool performs a 3 × 3 Prewitt edge-detection filter on a raster image. The Prewitt filter
is similar to theSobelFilter, in that it identifies areas of high slope in the input image through
the calculation of slopes in the x and y directions. The Prewitt edge-detection filter, however, gives less
weight to nearer cell values within the moving window, or kernel. For example, a Prewitt filter uses
the following schemes to calculate x and y slopes:

X-direction slope

Y-direction slope

Each grid cell in the output image is assigned the square-root of the squared sum of the x and y slopes.

The user may optionally clip the output image distribution tails by a specified amount (e.g. 1%).

RangeFilter

This tool performs a range filter on an input image (--input). A range filter assigns to each cell in the output grid
(--output) the range (maximum - minimum) of the values contained within a moving window centred on each grid cell.

Neighbourhood size, or filter size, is specified in the x and y dimensions using the--filterxand--filteryflags. These dimensions should be odd, positive integer values (e.g. 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.).

RobertsCrossFilter

This tool performs Robert's Cross edge-detection filter on a raster image. TheRobertsCrossFilteris similar to theSobelFilterandPrewittFilter, in that it identifies areas of high slope in the input
image through the calculation of slopes in the x and y directions. A Robert's Cross filter uses
the following 2 × 2 schemes to calculate slope magnitude, |G|:

|G| = |P1 - P4| + |P2- P3|

Note, the filter is centered on pixel P1 and P2, P3, and P4 are the neighbouring pixels towards the east, south,
and south-east respectively.

The output image may be overwhelmed by a relatively small number of high-valued pixels, stretching the
palette. The user may therefore optionally clip the output image distribution tails by a specified amount
(--clip) for improved visualization.

This tool performs a Scharr edge-detection filter on a raster image. The Scharr filter is similar to theSobelFilterandPrewittFilter, in that it identifies areas of high slope in the input image through
the calculation of slopes in the x and y directions. A 3 × 3 Scharr filter uses
the following schemes to calculate x and y slopes:

X-direction slope

SobelFilter

This tool performs a 3 × 3 or 5 × 5 Sobel edge-detection filter on a raster image. The Sobel filter
is similar to thePrewittFilter, in that it identifies areas of high slope in the input image through
the calculation of slopes in the x and y directions. The Sobel edge-detection filter, however, gives more
weight to nearer cell values within the moving window, or kernel. For example, a 3 × 3 Sobel filter uses
the following schemes to calculate x and y slopes:

X-direction slope

Y-direction slope

Each grid cell in the output image is assigned the square-root of the squared sum of the x and y slopes.

The user must specify the--variant, including '3x3' and '5x5' variants. The user may also optionally
clip the output image distribution tails by a specified amount (e.g. 1%).

This tool performs a standard deviation filter on an input image (--input). A standard deviation filter assigns to each cell in the output grid
(--output) thestandard deviation, a measure of dispersion, of the values contained within a moving window centred on each grid cell.

Neighbourhood size, or filter size, is specified in the x and y dimensions using the--filterxand--filteryflags. These dimensions should be odd, positive integer values (e.g. 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.).

UnsharpMasking

Unsharp masking is an image edge-sharpening technique commonly applied in digital image processing.
Admittedly, the name 'unsharp' seems somewhat counter-intuitive given the purpose of the filter, which
is to enchance the definition of edge features within the input image (--input). This name comes
from the use of a blurred, or unsharpened, intermediate image (mask) in the process. The blurred image
is combined with the positive (original) image, creating an image that exhibits enhanced feature definition.
A caution is needed in that the output image, although clearer, may be a less accurate representation
of the image's subject. The output may also contain more speckle than the input image.

In addition to the input (--input) and output (--output) image files, the user must specify the
values of three parameters: the standard deviation distance (--sigma), which is a measure of the
filter size in pixels, the amount (--amount), a percentage value that controls the magnitude of
each overshoot at edges, and lastly, the threshold (--threshold), which controls the minimal
brightness change that will be sharpened. Pixels with values differ after the calculation of the filter
by less than the threshold are unmodified in the output image.

UnsharpMaskingworks with both greyscale and red-green-blue (RGB) colour images. RGB images are
decomposed into intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) and the filter is applied to the intensity
channel. Importantly, the intensity values range from 0-1, which is important when setting the
threshold value for colour images. NoData values in the input image are ignored during processing.

UserDefinedWeightsFilter

NoData values in the input image are ignored during the convolution operation.
This can lead to unexpected behavior at the edges of images (since the default behavior
is to return NoData when addressing cells beyond the grid edge) and where the grid
contains interior areas of NoData values. Normalization of kernel weights can be useful
for handling the edge effects associated with interior areas of NoData values. When the
normalization option is selected, the sum of the cell value-weight product is divided
by the sum of the weights on a cell-by-cell basis. Therefore, if the kernel at a
particular grid cell contains neighboring cells of NoData values, normalization
effectively re-adjusts the weighting to account for the missing data values. Normalization
also ensures that the output image will possess values within the range of the input
image and allows the user to specify integer value weights in the kernel. However, note
that this implies that the sum of weights should equal one. In some cases, alternative
sums (e.g. zero) are more appropriate, and as such normalization should not be applied
in these cases.
