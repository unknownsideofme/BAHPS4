BalanceContrastEnhancement

This tool can be used to reduce colour bias in a colour composite image based on the
technique described by Liu (1991). Colour bias is a common phenomena with colour images
derived from multispectral imagery, whereby a higher average brightness value in one
band results in over-representation of that band in the colour composite. The tool
essentially applies a parabolic stretch to each of the three bands in a user specified
RGB colour composite, forcing the histograms of each band to have the same minimum,
maximum, and average values while maintaining their overall histogram shape. For greater
detail on the operation of the tool, please see Liu (1991). Aside from the names of the
input and output colour composite images, the user must also set the value of E, the
desired output band mean, where 20 < E < 235.

CorrectVignetting

This tool can be used to reduce vignetting within an image. Vignetting refers to the
reduction of image brightness away from the image centre (i.e. the principal point).
Vignetting is a radiometric distortion resulting from lens characteristics. The
algorithm calculates the brightness value in the output image (BVout) as:

BVout = BVin / [cos^n(arctan(d / f))]

Where d is the photo-distance from the principal point in millimetres, f is the focal
length of the camera, in millimeters, and n is a user-specified parameter. Pixel
distances are converted to photo-distances (in millimetres) using the specified
image width, i.e. distance between left and right edges (mm). For many cameras, 4.0
is an appropriate value of the n parameter. A second pass of the image is used to
rescale the output image so that it possesses the same minimum and maximum values as
the input image.

If an RGB image is input, the analysis will be performed on the intensity component
of the HSI transform.

DirectDecorrelationStretch

The Direct Decorrelation Stretch (DDS) is a simple type of saturation stretch. The stretch is
applied to a colour composite image and is used to improve the saturation, or colourfulness,
of the image. The DDS operates by reducing the achromatic (grey) component of a pixel's colour
by a scale factor (k), such that the red (r), green (g), and blue (b) components of the output
colour are defined as:

rk= r -kmin(r, g, b)

gk= g -kmin(r, g, b)

bk= b -kmin(r, g, b)

The achromatic factor (k) can range between 0 (no effect) and 1 (full saturation stretch),
although typical values range from 0.3 to 0.7. A linear stretch is used afterwards to adjust
overall image brightness. Liu and Moore (1996) recommend applying a colour balance stretch,
such asBalanceContrastEnhancementbefore using the DDS.

GaussianContrastStretch

This tool performs a Gaussian stretch on a raster image. The observed histogram of the input image is fitted
to a Gaussian histogram, i.e. normal distribution. A histogram matching technique is used to map the values from
the input image onto the output Gaussian distribution. The user must the number of tones (--num_tones) used in the
output image.

This tool is related to the more generalHistogramMatchingtool, which can be used to fit any frequency distribution
to an input image, and other contrast enhancement tools such asHistogramEqualization,MinMaxContrastStretch,PercentageContrastStretch,SigmoidalContrastStretch, andStandardDeviationContrastStretch.

HistogramEqualization

This tool alters the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a raster image to match,
as closely as possible, the CDF of a uniform distribution. Histogram equalization works
by first calculating the histogram of the input image. This input histogram is then
converted into a CDF. Each grid cell value in the input image is then mapped to the
corresponding value in the uniform distribution's CDF that has an equivalent (or as close
as possible) cumulative probability value. Histogram equalization provides a very effective
means of performing image contrast adjustment in an efficient manner with little need for
human input.

The user must specify the name of the input image to perform histogram equalization on.
The user must also specify the number of tones, corresponding to the number
of histogram bins used in the analysis.

HistogramEqualizationis related to theHistogramMatchingTwoImagestool (used when an image's
CDF is to be matched to a reference CDF derived from a reference image). Similarly,HistogramMatching,
andGaussianContrastStretchare similarly related tools frequently used for image contrast
adjustment, where the reference CDFs are uniform and Gaussian (normal) respectively.

Notes:

The algorithm can introduces gaps in the histograms (steps in the CDF). This is to be expected because
the histogram is being distorted. This is more prevalent for integer-level images.Histogram equalization is not appropriate for images containing categorical (class) data.

HistogramMatching

This tool alters the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a raster image to match,
as closely as possible, the CDF of a reference histogram. Histogram matching works by
first calculating the histogram of the input image. This input histogram and reference
histograms are each then converted into CDFs. Each grid cell value in the input image
is then mapped to the corresponding value in the reference CDF that has an equivalent
(or as close as possible) cumulative probability value. Histogram matching provides
the most flexible means of performing image contrast adjustment.

The reference histogram must be specified to the tool in the form of a text file (.txt),
provided using the--histo_fileflag. This file must contain two columns (delimited by
a tab, space, comma, colon, or semicolon) where the first column contains the x value
(i.e. the values that will be assigned to the grid cells in the output image) and the second
column contains the frequency or probability. Note that 1) the file must not contain a
header row, 2) each x value/frequency pair must be on a separate row, and 3) the
frequency/probability must not be cumulative (i.e. the file must contain the histogram and
not the CDF). The CDF will be computed for the reference histogram automatically by the tool.
It is possible to create this type of histogram using the wide range of distribution tools
available in most spreadsheet programs (e.g. Excel or LibreOffice's Calc program). You must
save the file as a text-only (ASCII) file.

HistogramMatchingis related to theHistogramMatchingTwoImagestool, which can be used
when a reference CDF can be derived from a reference image.HistogramEqualizationandGaussianContrastStretchare similarly related tools frequently used for image contrast
adjustment, where the reference CDFs are uniform and Gaussian (normal) respectively.

The algorithm can introduces gaps in the histograms (steps in the CDF). This is to be expected
because the histogram is being distorted. This is more prevalent for integer-level images.Histogram matching is not appropriate for images containing categorical (class) data.This tool is not intended for images containing RGB data. If this is the case, the colour

HistogramMatchingTwoImages

This tool alters the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a raster image to match, as closely
as possible, the CDF of a reference image. Histogram matching works by first calculating the
histograms of the input image (i.e. the image to be adjusted) and the reference image. These
histograms are then converted into CDFs. Each grid cell value in the input image is then mapped
to the corresponding value in the reference CDF that has the an equivalent (or as close as
possible) cumulative probability value. A common application of this is to match the images from
two sensors with slightly different responses, or images from the same sensor, but the sensor's
response is known to change over time.The size of the two images (rows and columns) do not need
to be the same, nor do they need to be geographically overlapping.

HistogramMatchingTwoImagesis related to theHistogramMatchingtool, which can be used
when a reference CDF is used directly rather than deriving it from a reference image.HistogramEqualizationandGaussianContrastStretchare similarly related tools, where the
reference CDFs are uniform and Gaussian (normal) respectively.

The algorithm may introduces gaps in the histograms (steps in the CDF). This is to be expected
because the histograms are being distorted. This is more prevalent for integer-level images.
Histogram matching is not appropriate for images containing categorical (class) data. It is also
not intended for images containing RGB data, in which case, the colour channels should be split

MinMaxContrastStretch

This tool performs a minimum-maximum contrast stretch on a raster image. This operation maps each grid cell
value in the input raster image (z) onto a new scale that ranges from the user-specified lower-tail clip
value (min_val) to the upper-tail clip value (max_val), with the specified number of tonal values
(num_tones), such that:

zout= ((zin– min_val)/(max_val – min_val)) x num_tones

where zoutis the output value. Notice that any values in the input image that are less thanmin_valare assigned a value ofmin_valin the output image. Similarly, any input values greater thanmax_valare assigned a value ofmax_valin the output image.

This is a type of linear contrast stretch with saturation at the tails of the frequency distribution. This is
the same kind of stretch that is used to display raster type data on the fly in many GIS software packages,
such that the lower and upper tail values are set using the minimum and maximum display values and the number
of tonal values is determined by the number of palette entries.

PanchromaticSharpening

Panchromatic sharpening, or simply pan-sharpening, refers to a range of techniques that can be used to merge
finer spatial resolution panchromatic images with coarser spatial resolution multi-spectral images. The
multi-spectral data provides colour information while the panchromatic image provides improved spatial information.
This procedure is sometimes called image fusion. Jensen (2015) describes panchromatic sharpening in detail.

Whitebox provides two common methods for panchromatic sharpening including the Brovey transformation and the
Intensity-Hue-Saturation (IHS) methods. Both of these techniques provide the best results when the range of
wavelengths detected by the panchromatic image overlap significantly with the wavelength range covered by the
three multi-spectral bands that are used. When this is not the case, the resulting colour composite will likely
have colour properties that are dissimilar to the colour composite generated by the original multispectral images.
For Landsat ETM+ data, the panchromatic band is sensitive to EMR in the range of 0.52-0.90 micrometres. This
corresponds closely to the green (band 2), red (band 3), and near-infrared (band 4).

PercentageContrastStretch

This tool performs a percentage contrast stretch on a raster image. This operation maps each grid cell value
in the input raster image (zin) onto a new scale that ranges from a lower-tail clip value (min_val)
to the upper-tail clip value (max_val), with the user-specified number of tonal values (num_tones), such that:

zout= ((zin– min_val)/(max_val – min_val)) x num_tones

where zoutis the output value. The values ofmin_valandmax_valare determined from the frequency
distribution and the user-specified tail clip value (--clip). For example, if a value of 1% is specified, the tool
will determine the values in the input image for which 1% of the grid cells have a lower valuemin_valand 1% of
the grid cells have a higher valuemax_val. The user must also specify which tails (upper, lower, or both) to clip
(--tail).

This is a type of linear contrast stretch with saturation at the tails of the frequency distribution. This is
the same kind of stretch that is used to display raster type data on the fly in many GIS software packages,
such that the lower and upper tail values are set using the minimum and maximum display values and the number
of tonal values is determined by the number of palette entries.

PiecewiseContrastStretch

Note this tool is part of aWhiteboxTools extension product. Please visitWhitebox Geospatial Inc.for information about purchasing a license
activation key (https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/extension-pricing/).

This tool can be used to perform a piecewise contrast stretch on an input image (--input). The input image
can be either a single-band image or a colour composite, in which case the contrast stretch will be
performed on the intensity values of the hue-saturation-intensity (HSI) transform of the colour image.
The user must also specify the name of the output image (--output) and the break-points that define the
piecewise function used to transfer brightness values from the input to the output image. The break-point
values are specified as a string parameter (--function), with each break-point taking the form of
(input value, output proportion); (input value, output proportion); (input value, output proportion), etc.
Piecewise functions can have as many break-points as desired, and each break-point should be separated by
a semicolon (;). The input values are specifies as brightness values in the same units as the input image
(unless it is an input colour composite, in which case the intensity values range from 0 to 1). The output
function must be specified as a proportion (from 0 to 1) of the output value range, which is specified by
the number of output greytones (--greytones). Thegreytonesparameter is ignored if the input image
is a colour composite.  Note that there is no need to specify the initial break-point to the piecewise
function, as (input min value; 0.0) will be inserted automatically. Similarly, an upper bound of the piecewise
function of (input max value; 1.0) will also be inserted automatically.

Generally you want to set breakpoints by examining the image histogram. Typically it is desirable to map
large unpopulated ranges of input brightness values in the input image onto relatively narrow ranges
of the output brightness values (i.e. a shallow sloped segment of the piecewise function), and areas of the
histogram that are well populated with pixels in the input image with a larger range of brightness
values in the output image (i.e. a steeper slope segment). This will have the effect of reducing the number
of tones used to display the under-populated tails of the distribution and spreading out the well-populated
regions of the histogram, thereby improving the overall contrast and the visual interpretability of the
output image. The flexibility of the piecewise contrast stretch can often provide a very suitable means of
significantly improving image quality.

SigmoidalContrastStretch

This tool performs a sigmoidal stretch on a raster image. This is a transformation where the input image value for a
grid cell (zin) is transformed to an output value zout such that:

zout= (1.0 / (1.0 + exp(gain(cutoff- z))) -a) /bxnum_tones

where,

z = (zin-MIN) /RANGE,

a= 1.0 / (1.0 + exp(gainxcutoff)),

b= 1.0 / (1.0 + exp(gainx (cutoff- 1.0))) - 1.0 / (1.0 + exp(gainxcutoff)),

MINandRANGEare the minimum value and data range in the input image respectively andgainandcutoffare
user specified parameters (--gain,--cutoff).

Like all ofWhiteboxTools's contrast enhancement tools, this operation will work on either greyscale or RGB input
images.

StandardDeviationContrastStretch

This tool performs a standard deviation contrast stretch on a raster image. This operation maps each grid cell value
in the input raster image (zin) onto a new scale that ranges from a lower-tail clip value (min_val)
to the upper-tail clip value (max_val), with the user-specified number of tonal values (num_tones), such that:

zout= ((zin– min_val)/(max_val – min_val)) x num_tones

where zoutis the output value. The values ofmin_valandmax_valare determined based on the image
mean and standard deviation. Specifically, the user must specify the number of standard deviations (--clipor--stdev) to be used in determining the min and max clip values. The tool will then calculate the input image mean
and standard deviation and estimate the clip values from these statistics.

This is the same kind of stretch that is used to display raster type data on the fly in many GIS software packages.
